```{r}

```

# load the data here

# lets do an EDA

# Clean this up

# Show some pretty graphs about the initial/cleaned up data

# Determine how this is clustered

# Determine what parameters this is getting clustered through

# Partitional Clustering?

# Hiearchical Clustering?

# K means Clustering?

# Divisive Clustering? 

# When do we tune?

# How do we measure "above average" perfomance? Percentage gain? 




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
