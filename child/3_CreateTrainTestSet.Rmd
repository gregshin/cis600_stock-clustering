## Create Train / Test Data Set

### Reading the datasets for Exploratory Analysis and Modelling.

After my evaluation of the data set, it seems to me we don't need to shuffle the data because the data is not ordered by a specific attribute, also we don't need to drop any of the data attributes/variables, we need all of them for the model.

In my design, I suggest to split the data 80/20, 80 percent of the data serves to train the model, and 20 percent to make predictions. We need to create two separate data frames. we don't want to touch the test set until we finish building your model.

```{r}
# Lets check the dimensions, structures of the loaded data and make ready for analysis as well as modelling.

# 80% of the sample size
smp_size <- floor(0.8 * nrow(dataSetReader))
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(dataSetReader)), size = smp_size)
train_data <- dataSetReader[train_ind, ]
test_data <- dataSetReader[-train_ind, ]
#DataSetReader
dim(dataSetReader)
#Train
dim(train_data)
#Test
dim(test_data)
# The train dataset has 16936286 rows while the test dataset has 4234072 rows.
# This function prop.table() combined with table() to verify if the randomization process is correct.
```
